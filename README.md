# Intern-Assignment

The Repositery contains the main.ipynb jupyter notebook which contains all the tasks 

But to Run the Notebook add the data file in the same folder as the main.ipynb,  as Github does not allow large file to be uploaded to the git hub repositery 

The libraries Required are:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

The notebook contains markdown cells mentioning which Task in being Performed and just run all cells in the begining and give it about 2 minutes to completely run every cell.


P.S I did not commit much as i did most of my work on a local machine.
